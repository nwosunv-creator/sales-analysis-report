Story of the data and Methodology

The data for the Koma Flamy Sales Report was collected from the company’s internal sales records, capturing key variables such as product category, region, customer demographics, quantity sold, cost, and profit. The dataset was first cleaned in Microsoft Excel to remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies, handle missing values and ensure accuracy.

After cleaning, the data was analyzed using Excel Pivot Tables to identify sales trends, high-performing products, and profit variations across different locations and customer segments. Visual dashboards were created to highlight key metrics such as total sales, top-selling products, and regional performance. This analytical approach provided actionable insights to support better decision-making and improve future sales strategies.

Promote gender-inclusive marketing strategies in the U.S., highlighting both performance-oriented and lifestyle-oriented biking experiences to appeal equally to males and females.

Replicate the success strategies of 2015 and 2016, such as promotional bundles, seasonal offers, or partnerships, to reignite high-performing sales trends

Investigate the Q3 dips in 2014 and 2016 to identify whether they were caused by seasonal demand shifts, competition, or supply chain disruptions, and address these issues proactively.

Introduce seasonal clothing campaigns during Q3 to stimulate demand, such as back-to-school promotions, end-of-summer clearance, or pre-fall fashion launches.

Apply predictive analytics to forecast demand trends and mitigate future dips by aligning production, inventory, and marketing activities with anticipated consumer behavior.
